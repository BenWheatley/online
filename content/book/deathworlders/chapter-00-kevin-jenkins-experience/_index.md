The first chapter of what would eventually become "The Deathworlders", was
posted on 4chan some years ago now, as a self-contained story.

At first I thought it had received some pleasant comments and then sank without
a trace. It was only after Reddit user "Guidosbestfriend" set his own story
"Humans Don't Make Good Pets" in the same universe and I confessed to having
created the setting that I learned that "The Kevin Jenkins Experience" was
considered a HFY classic.

Surprising as this was, I then decided to write a sequel, and from there the
clamor for more has picked me up and swept me along.

For those who are upset by the strongly antitheistic content of part 0.2, I
implore you to power on through it. You may be pleasantly surprised by the
resolution to that content.
