Sixty-five million years before the Vancouver Canucks and the Arizona Coyotes summarily pulped the Hunters attacking Rogers Arena, the Igraen Alliance was embroiled in a bloody war with the V'Straki Empire. The two warring species were brutal and ruthless in their pursuit of absolute victory. The repercussions of this war would last for eons, setting the stage for the shocking discovery of sapient life on Earth millions of years later.

Deathworld Origins is a companion story to Hambone's The Deathworlders. This series contains content that could spoil Deathworlders Chapter 17, so please read at least that far before beginning Deathworld Origins.
